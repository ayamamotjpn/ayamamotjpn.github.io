<title>Wellcome to Aperiodic Crystals</title>

This is the guide for tables and programs for modulated and
quasicrystal structure analyses, which are downloadable via web
(http://wcp-ap.hokudai.ac.jp/yamamoto/).<p> <p> The source codes of all the programs listed
below are available. Most codes are written in fortran 90 but
small parts are written in C++. Binary files included in a package were
compiled by GNU compiler gfortran and g++ for Linux and Mac, while
g95 and g++ for Windows.
Source codes can be compiled by the same compilers
in Linux, Mac and Windows under MSYS and MinGW. You may need to
compile the source codes due to the inconsistent library version
or any other reasons. Then edit makefile in the top directory directly
so as to choose your OS (one of ARC = 86 for
Linux, 86_64 for 64bit Linux, mac for Mac,  win for Windows).
(In the makefile, characters after # in each line are regarded as a comment.)
Then "make" command typed at the top directory
will create new binary files for your operating system in bin_86,
bin_86_64, bin_mac or
bin_win depending on the chosen OS.
(In Windows gfortran or g95 may not be installed. 
Install one of them and choose a compiler by
FC = gfortran or FC = g95 in the makefile.) Each (source) package
includes "help" directory, in which there are html files for the input
data instruction.
<p>
<b>For Windows users.</b> It is convenient to
install packages under the home directory in msys.
MSYS provides a minimum Unix environment under Windows OS and the
terminal emulator in MSYS is better than "command prompt" included
in Windows. (Any other compilers for Windows are available in Windows OS but
then you may need a completely different makefile. Note that the
current installation procedure
is applicable only under the use of MSYS and
MinGW in Windows OS.)
<p>
 After installing each package, you
need to set an enviroment variable CLCMPPATH, which is the
location (path) of "gprim.ps" file. This is included at the top directory in each package.
If you install several packages, you can specify one location
of the "gprim.ps" file. Add also the path of binary files (bin_86,
bin_win or bin_mac) in each package 
in the PATH environment variable. (Use control
panel in Windows, while in Linux or Mac, you can edit .bash_profile
or .cshrc in your home directory depending on the shell you use.)
<p>
 All the programs are terminal_based, so
that you need terminal emulators even in Windows OS. In a terminal
emulator, you can use all the program except for <b>extrhkl</b> by typing
a command name followed by "< standard_input_file". The standard_input
file should includes all the necessary informations for a program. (The
symbol "<" is necessary between the command name and standard
input file name.) For the data format of the standard_input_file
for each programs, see the help file with the program name.
The program <b>extrhkl</b> needs no standard
input file. Just type the command name and reply to questions shown
in the terminal.

The new version of the above package automatically calculates constraint conditions
for special positions, which are imposed by the site symmetry of each
atoms and in some cases they are very complicated. This can not however impose additional
 fictitious constraint conditions.

For compiling source codes, I recommend to use intel compiler in Linux.
Then you need to modify makefiles. FC=gfortran and CC=g++ (if any) should be replaced
by FC=ifort and FC=icc (in Windows, FC=g95 and CC=g++), respectively After that, "make clean" and "make" will
create binary files. (For the use of gfortran and g++, use -O0 (optimize) option in COPT=,  FCOPT=
 etc. Currently, the use of -O1, -O2, or -O3 option in gnu fortran and c++ may not work because of unknown reasons.)

For publications using the new version programs except for lodemac,
the following papers should be cited.

The program <b>lodemac</b> included in this package is the same as in
QUASI07_08.tgz, so that the paper mentioned before should be cited.
